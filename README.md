# Retail-Sales-Prediction
# Problem Statement-
Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied. You are provided with historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores. The task is to forecast the "Sales" column for the test set. Note that some stores in the dataset were temporarily closed for refurbishment.
# Business Problem
The interest in a product continues to change occasionally. No business can work on its monetary growth without assessing client interest and future demand of items precisely. Sales forecasting refers to the process of estimating demand for or sales of a particular product over a specific period of time. This project involves solving a real-world business problem of sales forecasting and building up a machine learning model for the same.

Our goal here is to forecast the sales for six weeks for each store and find out the factors influencing it and recommend ways in order to improve the numbers.

# Approach
